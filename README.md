# DIGITAL TWIN SERVICE

## Accessing API Documentation

To view the API documentation, navigate to [/api-docs/#/](http://localhost:3000/api-docs/#/) in your web browser after starting the project. This endpoint provides detailed documentation on API endpoints, request/response formats, and other necessary information for developers.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get your copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system to use npm (Node Package Manager).

### Installing

To get a development environment running, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dijital-Twin/service
cd service
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables**

Copy the `.env-test` file to a new file named `.env` and fill in the environment values as necessary. The `.env-test` file lists all the required environment variables needed to run the project.

4. **Run the project**

```bash
npm start
```

After successfully running the project, the backend service will start, and you can begin to interact with the APIs.
